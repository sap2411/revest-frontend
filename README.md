# Revest - Frontend

Revest is an application that analyses a users bank data, generates customized bugets, and tracks there spending in order to encourage saving and investing.

## Motivation

I wanted to create an app that could encourage young professionals to take charge of their finances and concider investing. I had been learning a lot about these topics over the year by seeing other peoples financials used as examples for how to budget properly, and I wanted to give that ability to any user specifically.
